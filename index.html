        <h2>About Me</h2>           
        <p>My background in Computing Science, specifically Advanced Higher Computing, Level 6 Cyber Security and Level 6 Games Development has given me a very solid foundation upon I believe I could build a career in Technology. Experiencing and applying computational thinking to solving complex problems, features across all courses. I have had the opportunity to analyse, design, develop, implement, test and evaluate digital solutions (including computer programmes) to complex problems across a range of contexts. Yet I have also learned a great deal of the impact of computing upon the environment and society, which has given me a rounded view on technology.</p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          <h3>Analytical Skills</h3>
          <p>I believe my key strength is my keen analytical skills; in terms of data and critical analysis. I can recognize the human, interpersonal and technical side of problems. I am excited to apply my analytical skills to fulfil business requirements.</p>
  
          <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
          <p>I enjoy solving problems and feel confident in my ability to look at situations from multiple angles and perspectives. I can solve problems collaboratively or independently.</p>
  
          <h3>Communication</h3>
          <p>Through my experiences at school I have become a confident communicator and have then applied these skills outside of the school environment. I take care to communicate in a respectful tone and manner. I am an active listener and always encourage the participation of others in conversation. I can write clearly in different contexts.</p>

          <h3>Team Working</h3>
          <p>I am a strong collaborator in teams. I understand that everyone brings something to the table and that we are simply not as effective individually as we can be as a whole. I would look forward to this aspect of a Graduate Apprenticeship, as it is clearly key to success.</p>
      
          <p>I am currently learning to drive and expect to have my license by July.</p>
